          "text": "Table 1:\nKPI | Description\nNeeded / On Order | For Work\nThis KPI identifies parts required for ongoing work orders. It focuses on parts that are needed for current maintenance activities and their availability status. Needed Definition\nParts that are required for work orders but currently have zero available quantity in inventory. Criteria\nThe part must be required for one or more active work orders. The part must have zero available quantity. We do not consider parts with positive available quantities, even if they are less than the required amount for the work order. On Order Definition\nParts that are required for work orders and have a purchase order created, but still have zero available quantity in inventory. Criteria\nThe part must be required for one or more active work orders. The part must have zero available quantity. A purchase order has been created for the part, indicating an effort to replenish inventory. We do not compare the quantity on the purchase order with the actual need in the work orders. Even if the purchase order quantity is less than the required quantity, the part is shown in this category. Out of Stock\nThis KPI tracks parts that are completely out of stock and assesses whether they meet minimum stock requirements. Needed Definition\nParts that are out of stock, have zero available quantity, and no purchase order has been created for them. Criteria\nThe part must have zero available quantity. Minimum stock levels must be set for the part (minimum stock levels should not be null). No purchase order has been created for the part. On Order Definition\nParts that are out of stock, have zero available quantity, and have a purchase order created. Criteria\nThe part must have zero available quantity. Minimum stock levels must be set for the part. A purchase order has been created for the part. For parts with zero available quantity and a purchase order quantity less than the minimum stock levels, these parts should be listed under the \"Needed\" filter as well, since they do not meet the minimum stock requirement even though a purchase order is in place. Low Stock Description:\nThis KPI identifies parts with inventory levels below the set minimum stock levels and assesses whether purchase orders have been created to address the shortage. Needed Definition\nParts that have available quantities less than the minimum stock levels and for which no purchase order has been created. Criteria\nThe available quantity must be less than the minimum stock levels set for the part. No purchase order has been created for the part. On Order Definition\nParts that have available quantities below the minimum stock levels but have a purchase order created. Criteria\nThe available quantity must be less than the minimum stock levels set for the part. A purchase order has been created for the part. Warehouse Utilization | Warehouse Utilization measures the percentage of bin locations in a warehouse that are actively used for storing parts. This KPI helps assess how effectively the available space is being utilized, indicating whether the warehouse is operating at its optimal capacity. Formula\nWarehouse Utilization(%) = (Number of Bin Locations with Parts / Total Number of Bin Locations ) × 100 \nExample Calculation\nTotal Number of Bin Locations: Suppose the warehouse has 10 bin locations. Number of Bin Locations with Parts: Out of these, 8 bin locations are occupied with parts. Using the formula:\nWarehouse Utilization(%)=(8/10)×100=80%\nIn this example, the Warehouse Utilization is 80%, indicating that 80% of the available bin locations are currently in use. Inventory Totals | On Hand Total\nThis KPI measures the total count of all parts currently available in a specific warehouse. The total quantity of all parts that are physically present in a given warehouse. The on-hand also considers the parts allocated to any work orders but not consumed yet. Unique Parts Total\nThis KPI counts the total number of distinct parts created across the entire organization, regardless of the warehouse or site. Value\nThis KPI calculates the total valuation of all parts within a specific warehouse. Definition\nThe aggregate monetary value of inventory based on the on-hand quantity and cost of each part in a given warehouse. Formula\nTotal Value = Sum of (On-Hand Quantity of Each Part * Cost per Unit of Each Part)\nFrom Last Month\nThis KPI measures the percentage change in the on-hand quantity of parts compared to the previous month. Definition\nThe percentage difference in the total on-hand quantity of parts from the previous month to the current month. This metric indicates how inventory levels have changed over time, providing insight into trends and inventory management effectiveness. Formula\nPercentage Change = [(Current Month On Hand Total - Last Month On Hand Total) / Last Month On Hand Total] * 100\nFor example, if the on-hand total last month was 500 units and this month it is 600 units, the calculation would be:\nPercentage Change = [(600 - 500) / 500] * 100 = 20%."
